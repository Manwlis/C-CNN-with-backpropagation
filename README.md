# C++-CNN-with-backpropagation

This repository consists of an C++ implentation of training a CNN with the backprogation algorithm, and an equivalent Python/TF one. It was meant as a stepping stone between the Python/TF implementation and an FPGA accelerated one.

The code is close to what the FPGA development tools require, thus the overall structure might look kinda odd. Furthermore, each part of each layer has its own function or more.

Bathcing is not implemented, but id most probably trivial to do.
